    <p>Computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe
        the functionality,
        organization, and implementation of computer systems.
        Some definitions of architecture define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer
        but not a particular implementation.
        In other definitions computer architecture involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture
        design, logic design, and implementation.</p>

    <P>In essence, a computer is a machine designed to process, store, and retrieve data. Data may be numbers in a
        spreadsheet, characters of text in a document, dots of color in an image, waveforms of sound, or the state of
        some system, such as an air conditioner or a CD player. All data is stored in the computer as numbers. It’s easy
        to forget this when we’re deep in C code, contemplating complex algorithms and data structures.</p>


    <p> The computer manipulates the data by performing operations on the numbers. Displaying an image on a screen is
        accomplished by moving an array of numbers to the video memory, each number representing a pixel of color. To
        play an MP3 audio file, the computer reads an array of numbers from disk and into memory, manipulates those
        numbers to convert the compressed audio data into raw audio data, and then outputs the new set of numbers (the
        raw audio data) to the audio chip.</p>


    <p> Everything that a computer does, from web browsing to printing, involves moving and processing numbers. The
        electronics of a computer is nothing more than a system designed to hold, move, and change numbers.
        A computer system is composed of many parts, both hardware and software. At the heart of the computer is the
        processor, the hardware that executes the computer programs. The computer also has memory, often several
        different types in one system. The memory is used to store programs while the processor is running them, as well
        as store the data that the programs are manipulating. The computer also has devices for storing data, or
        exchanging data with the outside world. These may allow the input of text via a keyboard, the display of
        information on a screen, or the movement of programs and data to or from a disk drive.</P>



    <h2 style="font-size:40px;">Processors :</h2>
    <p>The processor is the most important part of a computer, the component around which everything else is centered.
        In essence, the processor is the computing part of the computer. A processor is an electronic device capable of
        manipulating data (information) in a way specified by a sequence of instructions. The instructions are also
        known as opcodes or machine code . This sequence of instructions may be altered to suit the application, and,
        hence, computers are programmable. A sequence of instructions is what constitutes a program.<br> <a

    <h2 style="font-size:40px;">Memory :</h2>
    <p>Memory is used to hold data and software for the processor. There is a variety of memory types <br> <a

    <h2 style="font-size:40px;">Ram :</h2>
    <p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory. This is a bit of a misnomer, since most (all) computer memory may be
        considered “random access.” RAM is the “working memory” in the computer system <br><a href="ram.html">Read more

    <h2 style="font-size:40px;">Rom :</h2>
    <p>ROM stands for Read-Only Memory. This is also a bit of a misnomer, since many (modern) ROMs can also be written
        to <br> <a href="rom.html">Read more about Rom</a></p>


    <h2 style="font-size:40px;">Input/Output :</h2>
    <p>The address space of the processor can contain devices other than memory. These are input/output devices (I/O
        devices, also known as peripherals ) and are used by the processor to communicate with the external world <br><a
