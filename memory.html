    <p>Memory is used to hold data and software for the processor. There is a variety of memory types, and often a mix
        is used within a single system. Some memory will retain its contents while there is no power, yet will be slow
        to access. Other memory devices will be high-capacity, yet will require additional support circuitry and will be
        slower to access. Still other memory devices will trade capacity for speed, yielding relatively small devices,
        yet will be capable of keeping up with the fastest of processors.

        Memory chips can be organized in two ways, either in word-organized or bit-organized schemes. In the
        word-organized scheme, complete nybbles, bytes, or words are stored within a single component, whereas with
        bit-organized memory, each bit of a byte or word is allocated to a separate component</p>

    <p>Memory chips come in different sizes, with the width specified as part of the size description. For instance, a
        DRAM (dynamic RAM) chip might be described as being 4M×1 (bit-organized), whereas a SRAM (static RAM) may be
        512K×8 (word-organized). In both cases, each chip has exactly the same storage capacity, but organized in
        different ways. In the DRAM case, it would take eight chips to complete a memory block for an 8-bit data bus,
        whereas the SRAM would only require one chip.However, because the DRAMs are organized in parallel, they are
        accessed simultaneously. The final size of the DRAM block is (4M×1)×8 devices, which is 32M. It is common
        practice for multiple DRAMs to be placed on a memory module. This is the common way that DRAMs are installed in
        standard computers.

        The common widths for memory chips are x1, x4, and x8, although x16 devices are available. A 32-bit-wide bus can
        be implemented with thirty-two x1 devices, eight x4 devices, or four x8 devices.</p>
