    <p>The processor is the most important part of a computer, the component around which everything else is centered.
        In essence, the processor is the computing part of the computer. A processor is an electronic device capable of
        manipulating data (information) in a way specified by a sequence of instructions. The instructions are also
        known as opcodes or machine code . This sequence of instructions may be altered to suit the application, and,
        hence, computers are programmable. A sequence of instructions is what constitutes a program</p>

    <p>Instructions in a computer are numbers, just like data. Different numbers, when read and executed by a processor,
        cause different things to happen. A good analogy is the mechanism of a music box. A music box has a rotating
        drum with little bumps, and a row of prongs. As the drum rotates, different prongs in turn are activated by the
        bumps, and music is produced. In a similar way, the bit patterns of instructions feed into the execution unit of
        the processor. Different bit patterns activate or deactivate different parts of the processing core. Thus, the
        bit pattern of a given instruction may activate an addition operation, while another bit pattern may cause a
        byte to be stored to memory.</p>

    <p>A sequence of instructions is a machine-code program. Each type of processor has a different instruction set,
        meaning that the functionality of the instructions (and the bit patterns that activate them) varies. Processor
        instructions are often quite simple, such as “add two numbers” or “call this function.” In some processors,
        however, they can be as complex and sophisticated as “if the result of the last operation was zero, then use
        this particular number to reference another number in memory, and then increment the first number once you’ve
        finished.” This will be covered in more detail in the section on CISC and RISC processors, later in this
        chapter.</p>
